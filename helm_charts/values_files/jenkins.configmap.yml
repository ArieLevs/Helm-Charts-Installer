          Welcome to our build server.

          This Jenkins is 100% configured and managed 'as code'.
          Config is now mostly handled by 'Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin' (JCasC).
          JCasC config can be found in the jenkins.yaml file in the $JENKINS_HOME/casc/ folder.

          some settings are still injected from init.groovy.d scripts,
          but these settings will be ported over to JCasC as support becomes available.
